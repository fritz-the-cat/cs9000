cs9000
======
My very first python program.

Its is supposed to control a cs9000 wire prep machine which i got almost free.

This is python code to control a Schleuniger CS9000 Automatic wire processing cut and strip machine
this machine has a minimal front panel
ie No LCD only some push button switches

It has a 6500 variant processor
I dis-assembled the roms and reverse engineered the code
